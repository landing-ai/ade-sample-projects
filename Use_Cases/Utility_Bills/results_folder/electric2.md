This bill reflects changes in the Supply and Delivery portions of
your bill, effective June 1, 2020. The change in the Supply portion of
your bill is a result of the statewide supply auction that was approved
by the BPU on February 5, 2020. The change in the Delivery portion of
your bill is a result of a small decrease to the Non-Utility Generation
Charge. As a result of these changes, a typical residential customer who
receives electric supply from PSE&G and uses 6,920 kilowatt-hours per
year will see an average monthly increase of $5.57 or 4.1%. Tariff
information may also be found by visiting pseg.com.
